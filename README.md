## My_Hunter

In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of a finite Endless Running
Game.

The basic rules for the my_runner are as follows:
 - the player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter.
 - enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position.
 - the player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies.
 - as the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.
 - when the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window.

## Getting started

1) Download this repository.
2) ```make re```  
3) ```./my_runner```

You can create your map by editing /level/level[1-9].
